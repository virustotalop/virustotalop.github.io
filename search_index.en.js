This is the first blog post on my newly redesigned website! I figured what better way to kick off the blog posts besides detailing how the website was built! This website was built primarily using jquery for dynamic loading and blog posts are generated using showdown. \nDesign Philosophy\nThe design philosophy for this website has been to try to architect concepts from the ground up as much as possible. While I could have used frameworks such as react or angular to design the website I decided to try to roll my own system instead. The reasons for this being that I don't really like web design but I do like programming and what better to try to enjoy web design besides trying to roll my own system for generating and putting that content on the page. \nPage Loading\nThe way the website works from a design standpoint is fairly simple. I have an index.html that has the static header and footer that is rendered on every page. Every page is then rendered via their own Javascript file that gets loaded in from the index.html. This page loading is done by the PageRegistrar\n\nBelow is an example of how the home page gets rendered\n\nWhen the register method gets called the Page object for home gets registered as a page. Then when a page is navigated to the page if not already loaded it is then lazily loaded with jquery.\n\nEven though I had pages that could be dynamically loaded at this point what about those browser navigation buttons? Well as I would learn that was actually pretty easy to implement! Below you can find how I handle forward and back buttons. The gist of is that I use the popstate and then extract the page from the url by using a bit of string manipulation.\n\nBuilding a blog\nBuilding a fully static blog was something I wanted to do but I couldn't find a great way of doing it. I knew of frameworks for fully static websites such as hugo but I didn't want a monolithic framework to build off of. So then I set off with this issue all the way back in May of 2020. In the end I didn't find a solution directly to my problem but I did manage to hammer my way to a solution when maybe I needed a different tool. In comes showdown, highlightjs and jquery to the rescue. The blog works by loading a json file that has some metadata about the blog post.\n\nThis file has the label for the post, then name of the corresponding file and the time of which the post was created. This data is then loading in via jquery \n\nThe data from each post is then processed to get the relevant blog post information.\n\nThe blog post is then taken and tranformed with showdown and then formatted.\n\nThere is probably a better way of doing the html formatting but 🤷‍♂️. After the code is formatted the code then gets added to the dom via jquery as well as some formatting and changing the display of the post.\n\nThank you for reading\nIf you made it this far thank you for reading. Blogging is something I intend on doing in the future because hopefully someone else will find it helpful if they somehow stumble across this as well as it allowing me to reflect on the technical details of different projects. If you want to see anything that I missed or or to try to find any of the hidden features you can find the code here on Github I would also like to thank all the people who helped me design or come up with ideas for this website. Check them out, they are all really cool people.\nCredits\nThank you to the all the people who helped with the design of this website.\n@DanHues\n@FelixOBrien\n@haloflooder\n@lhurt51\n@magicmq\n","id":"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/blog/first/","title":"Hello World"},"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/blog/second/":{"body":"🐉 Here be dragons! We are in uncharted territory... err at least I am! I decided to redo my personal website again because there were a few things I wasn't happy with. The performance of using a lot of JavaScript where things could be built and then deployed led to my decision to start looking into static website generators. I've used a few static website generators before those being: Hugo, Jekyll and MkDocs. I gravitated towards Hugo again but after some trouble getting things on first run working I decided to look for an alternative and I landed on this blog post by Gitlab. I had never heard of Zola before so I decided to look at the documentation and it looked like just what I was looking for. So off I went getting it running in docker.\nSo many things to do\nI wasn't sure what direction exactly I wanted to go in when I decided to redo my website but I had a few issues issues that I wanted to tackle.\n\nBlog performance\nCode card performance\nThe ability to keep the website a SPA \n\nPerformance\nThe blog system and code cards were built using a very similar system. The general idea is that the content is taken from JSON and markdown files in the case of the blog and then the elements were inserting into the dom. The issue with this is that numerous inserts on page load would slow down page loads and in the case of the blog the content inserts into the dom could be quite large.\nTo try to work against this performance issue the idea was just to compile the content before it is ever served to the user, similar to server side rendering but without the server. So instead of loading in content from JSON and markdown files when the web page is being loaded we just pre-render everything that would be put on the page. Below is an example of before and after how code cards were loaded.\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nResults\nWell.... I don't have any real performance metrics yet but from the limited testing I have done with Lighthouse metrics the page load for the blog is very fast scoring a 99 as of writing this blog post. I may write a more detailed blog post later but this refactor was done primarily because I could see the writing on the wall for performance. The blog was the most egregious violation of performance, I was able to mostly solve this by making the content truncate but I wasn't happy with the implementation and it felt hacky at best. That being said the blog has been redesigned for now to only show the post's title, publication date and a button to read more. This will likely be redone later to restore something similar to the previous solution but built ahead of time.\nSPA (single page application) Framework\nI was able to keep my previous SPA framework that I built and use it mostly the same. There were some things that needed to be done like telling pages where to load from since zola puts them in a different location. In the future the SPA framework does need to be cleaned up since I currently have instances like this in the code still.\n\nEventually I will convert all the pages to zola or they may all be by the time this actually gets published to my site. When all the pages are converted I should just then be able to have something like the below.\n\nOver time I'm sure I will probably add more properties but I would like to fully remove the JavaScript rendering system I built.\nSo Long and Thanks for all the Fish\nWell if you actually decided to read this thank you! I don't think anyone is actually going to read this but putting some of the technical details from things I work on into writing gives me some interesting ideas and allows me to reflect on the work that I've done.

While working on BLIS I learned a variety of skills, the most valuable of those being how to debug a legacy PHP application. \n","id":"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/home/blis/","title":"BLIS"},"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/home/dynamicgui/":{"body":"A plugin that make writing menus for Minecraft easy.

ObbyLang supports: Bukkit servers, Bungeecord, Velocity and Discord (JDA). Supports hot reloading of script files which speeds up development by a large amount. Also supports a number of needed tools such as: SQL databases, Redis, InfluxDB and MongoDB. Developed at ClubObsidian and has been deployed and in use for over 3 years. ObbyLang takes advantage of nashorn's ability to compile JavaScript down to lambdas for very fast execution. This speed has been tested with over 200,000 actions being executed every second with no slowdown to the Minecraft server. \n","id":"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/home/obbylang/","title":"ObbyLang"},"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/home/randomjs/":{"body":"A port of Java's Random class to JavaScript. Random.js was created due to scavenger hunts that were hosted on ClubObsidian that I needed a port of Java's random class for as seen here. This was used to generate random values on the server and client side that would be the same without using any code that would communicate with the frontend. \n","id":"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/home/randomjs/","title":"Random.js"},"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/home/virustotalop/":{"body":"This website has been a labor of love of trying to push the limits of what is possible while using only a static website. This website uses a SPA (single page application) framework that I wrote that uses only jQuery. The SPA framework that supports lazy loading and has full navigation support. This website has gone through a few iterations, I used to generate the blog and code cards with json but now they are built using zola. There is also at least one easter egg on this website if you take a look at the source code! \n","id":"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/home/virustotalop/","title":"virustotalop.github.io"}},"docInfo":{"https://virustotalop.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/blog/first/":{"body":319,"title":2},"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/blog/second/":{"body":335,"title":2},"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/home/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/home/anonymizing-text/":{"body":49,"title":2},"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/home/blis/":{"body":33,"title":1},"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/home/dynamicgui/":{"body":58,"title":1},"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/home/obbylang/":{"body":63,"title":1},"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/home/randomjs/":{"body":32,"title":1},"https://virustotalop.github.io/page/home/virustotalop/":{"body":51,"title":1}},"length":11},"lang":"English"};
