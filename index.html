<p>I figured I would write a little about myself to give people who view this page a little bit of backstory on my programming experience. I started programming in 2009, writing little projects in visual basic but I really had no clue what I was doing. I started really programming in 2011 when I took an AP Computer Science class that taught Java. I am now working on getting my bachelors in computer science, which I am going into my third year of college for. Since my beginnings with Java I have had experience with C++ and Assembly the specific variant being masm. I primarily program for the Minecraft server I own <a href="http://www.clubobsidian.com">ClubObsidian</a>, however I do occasionally take freelance work normally in the Java programming language. As a closing, no I am not affiliated with the VirusTotal service however I do respect what they do. If you ever want to scan a file I suggest you check out the <a href="http://www.virustotal.com">website.</a> </p>

<a id="experience" class="anchor" href="#experience" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experience</h3>

<ul>
<li>Java - 4 years of experience - I would consider myself advanced with Java however I do not usually work on large projects.</li>
<li>C++ - 1 year - I am a beginner in C++  because I do not use it often, however I am proficient enough to make small console based programs because I have never looked into making GUI applications.</li>
<li>MASM - 6 months - I have a grasp on asm but its nothing that I would even dare to take commission work for.</li>
</ul>
