			<h4 class="card-title text-center">Anonymizing Text</h4>
			<p class="card-text"><p>A project that attempts to remove author attribution by indentifying stylometry methods in written works. Written as my capstone project at California State University Monterey Bay. Implemented as a browser plugin using <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise">compromise</a> for natural language processing. Testing was implemented using: <a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium">selenium</a> for browser automation, <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">flask</a> for serving a test website, <a href="https://github.com/praw-dev/praw">praw</a> for scrapping reddit for test data and <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui">PyAutoGUI</a> for interacting with the browser's UI. Data was then analyzed using <a href="https://github.com/sloria/TextBlob">textblob</a>. </p>

			<h4 class="card-title text-center">BLIS</h4>
			<p class="card-text"><p>While working on BLIS(Basic Laboratory Information System) I worked with a team to get the application ready to move from on premisis to cloud deployments. The team and I worked with our partners to ensure that the test deployments went smoothly. While working on BLIS I learned a variety of skills, the most valuable of those being how to debug a legacy PHP application. </p>

			<h4 class="card-title text-center">ObbyLang</h4>
			<p class="card-text"><p>A JavaScript toolkit for making content quickly. ObbyLang supports: Bukkit servers, Bungeecord, Velocity and Discord (JDA). Supports hot reloading of script files which speeds up development by a large amount. Also supports a number of needed tools such as: SQL databases, Redis, InfluxDB and MongoDB. Developed at ClubObsidian and has been deployed and in use for over 3 years. ObbyLang takes advantage of nashorn's ability to compile JavaScript down to lambdas for very fast execution. This speed has been tested with over 200,000 actions being executed every second with no slowdown to the Minecraft server. </p>

			<h4 class="card-title text-center">Random.js</h4>
			<p class="card-text"><p>A port of Java's Random class to JavaScript. Random.js was created due to scavenger hunts that were hosted on ClubObsidian that I needed a port of Java's random class for <a href="https://clubobsidian.github.io/ctc/">as seen here.</a> This was used to generate random values on the server and client side that would be the same without using any code that would communicate with the frontend. </p>

			<h4 class="card-title text-center">virustotalop.github.io</h4>
			<p class="card-text"><p>This website has been a labor of love of trying to push the limits of what is possible while using only a static website. This website uses a SPA (single page application) framework that I wrote that uses only jQuery. The SPA framework that supports lazy loading and has full navigation support. This website has gone through a few iterations, I used to generate the blog and code cards with json but now they are built using <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">zola.</a> There is also at least one easter egg on this website if you take a look at the source code! </p>
