{"name":"Virustotalop.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"### Introduction\r\nI figured I would write a little about myself to give people who view this page a little bit of backstory on my programming experience. I started programming in 2009, writing little projects in visual basic but I really had no clue what I was doing. I started really programming in 2011 when I took an AP Computer Science class that taught Java. I have since when on to work on getting my bachelors in computer science, which I am going into my third year of college for. Since then I have had experience with C++ and Assembly the specific variant being masm. I primarily program for the Minecraft server I own [ClubObsidian](www.clubobsidian.com), however I do occasionally take freelance work normally in the Java programming language.\r\n\r\n### Experience\r\n* Java - 4 years of experience - I would consider myself advanced with Java however I do not usually work on large projects.\r\n* C++ - 1 year - I am a beginner in C++  because I do not use it often, however I am proficient enough to make small console based programs because I have never looked into making GUI applications.\r\n* MASM - 6 months - I have a grasp on asm but its nothing that I would even dare to take commission work for.\r\n\r\n### Jobs or Contact\r\nIf you want to contact me go ahead and make an issue on my [github contact repository.](https://github.com/virustotalop/Contact)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
