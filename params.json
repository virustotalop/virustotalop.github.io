{"name":"Virustotal","tagline":"","body":"### Introduction\r\nI figured I would write a little about myself to give people who view this page a little bit of backstory on my programming experience. I started programming in 2009, writing little projects in VB.Net but I really had no clue what I was doing. I started learning how to program in 2011 when I took an AP Computer Science class that taught Java. I have since when on to work on getting my bachelors in Computer Science, which I am going into my third year of college for. Since then I have had experience with C++ and Assembly the specific variant being masm. I primarily program for the Minecraft server I own [ClubObsidian](http://www.clubobsidian.com), however I do occasionally take freelance work normally in the Java programming language. As a closing, no I am not affiliated with the VirusTotal service however I do respect what they do. If you ever want to scan a file I suggest you check out the [website.](http://www.virustotal.com) \r\n\r\n### Experience\r\n* Java - I have approximately 5 years of experience in programming in the Java programming language. I would consider myself advanced with Java, I do not have any experience with Android development as I find Xml disgusting. I have experience with working with larger scale projects, reflection, custom classloaders, bytecode modification and reverse-engineering.\r\n* C++ - I have approximately a year of experience with C++ but I am not familiar with most of the built in libraries off hand. I have only worked on smaller scaled applications in this language.\r\n* MASM - I have dabbled in MASM but I am primarily familiar with the proprietary library that I learned with. \r\n\r\n### Jobs or Contact\r\nIf you want to contact me go ahead and make an issue on my [github contact repository.](https://github.com/virustotalop/Contact)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
