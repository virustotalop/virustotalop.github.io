This website has been a labor of love of trying to push the limits of what is possible while using only a static website. This website uses a SPA \(single page application\) framework that I wrote that uses only jQuery. The SPA framework that supports lazy loading and has full navigation support. This website has gone through a few iterations, I used to generate the blog and code cards with json but now they are built using [zola.](https://www.getzola.org/) There is also at least one easter egg on this website if you take a look at the source code!
