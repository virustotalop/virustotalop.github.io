A JavaScript toolkit for making content quickly. ObbyLang supports: Bukkit servers, Bungeecord, Velocity and Discord (JDA). Supports hot reloading of script files which speeds up development by a large amount. Also supports a number of needed tools such as: SQL databases, Redis, InfluxDB and MongoDB. Developed at ClubObsidian and has been deployed and in use for over 3 years. ObbyLang takes advantage of nashorn's ability to compile JavaScript down to lambdas for very fast execution. This speed has been tested with over 200,000 actions being executed every second with no slowdown to the Minecraft server.
