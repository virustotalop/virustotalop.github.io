While working on BLIS(Basic Laboratory Information System) I worked with a team to get the application ready to move from on premisis to cloud deployments. The team and I worked with our partners to ensure that the test deployments went smoothly. While working on BLIS I learned a variety of skills, the most valuable of those being how to debug a legacy PHP application.
