A port of Java's Random class to JavaScript. Random.js was created due to scavenger hunts that were hosted on ClubObsidian that I needed a port of Java's random class for [as seen here.](https://clubobsidian.github.io/ctc/) This was used to generate random values on the server and client side that would be the same without using any code that would communicate with the frontend.
